# OpenAI powered ChatBot

This repository fine tunes a LLM using the OpenAI API. This was inspired after taking the free course on how to construct a chatbot app from [deeplearnin.ai](https://www.deeplearning.ai/short-courses/langchain-chat-with-your-data/) using `langchain`. 
I fine tune it using my PhD thesis. The jupyter notebook runs the program. You will need a OpenaAI API key.
