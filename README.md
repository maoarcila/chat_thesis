# OpenAI powered ChatBot

This repository fine-tunes a LLM using the OpenAI API. This was inspired after taking the free course on how to construct a chatbot app from [deeplearnin.ai](https://www.deeplearning.ai/short-courses/langchain-chat-with-your-data/) using `langchain`. 
By default, it uses my PhD thesis but you may change the pdf document. The Jupyter Notebook runs the program and you will need an OpenaAI API key for it to work.
